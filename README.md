A simple web scraper for gathering data from subreddit's.

# CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON
Details:

It initially worked using selenium to load Reddits dynamic pages, however as time goes on, pages become too large to really work with and it causes chrome or firefox depending on the driver being used to become unstable. To resolve this I will be changing how some of this works to not rely on chrome/firefox as much. A more static approach will be utilized to obtain subreddit data.
